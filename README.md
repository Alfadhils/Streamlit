# Streamlit 30 Days Challenge Archive

Welcome to the Streamlit 30 Days Challenge Archive repository! This repository is my comprehensive collection of tutorials and projects related to the 30 days challange from streamlit.

## Introduction

Streamlit is an open-source Python library that makes it easy to create beautiful, interactive web apps for machine learning, data exploration, and more. The Streamlit 30 Days Challenge was a community initiative aimed at providing developers with daily challenges, tutorials, and projects to help them learn and master Streamlit over the course of a month.
This repository serves as an archive for my work on the Streamlit 30 Days Challenge, containing source codes and projects that cover various aspects of Streamlit app development.

## Projects
1. YouTube Analytics

The YouTube Analytics project demonstrates how to build a Streamlit app for analyzing YouTube video metrics. You can visualize data such as views, likes, comments, and engagement over time, allowing you to gain insights into the performance of your YouTube channel. The data are provided by Ken Jee Youtube Channel and can be accessed through [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kenjee/ken-jee-youtube-data).

2. Zero-shot Text Classification using Hugging Face

This project showcases how to leverage the Hugging Face Transformers library to perform zero-shot text classification in a Streamlit app. You can input any text and classify it into predefined categories without the need for labeled training data, making it ideal for tasks such as sentiment analysis and topic modeling. My project are currently deployed on the streamlit community cloud and can be accessed [here](https://st-app-deploy.streamlit.app/).

3. YouTube Thumbnail Scraper

The YouTube Thumbnail Scraper project demonstrates how to create a Streamlit app for scraping thumbnails from YouTube videos. You can input a video URL and retrieve the thumbnail image, allowing you to quickly gather visual assets for your own projects or analysis.
